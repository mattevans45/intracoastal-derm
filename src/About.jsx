                Dr. Blair Harris was born and raised in northern Utah. He
                graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in
                Business Management with an emphasis in finance. After working
                as a financial analyst at Lockheed Martin in southern California
                for three years, he decided to pursue his lifelong dream of
                becoming a doctor. Dr. Harris attended medical school at Pacific
                Northwest University in Yakima, Washington. While in medical
                school, he was elected to a position in student government and
                enjoyed serving his fellow students. His leadership position
                enabled him to institute multiple organizational changes
                including implementing mental health resources, student support
                groups, and financial tracking instruments for the student
                government organization at PNWU.

              <p className="prose-xl prose-neutral mt-8 max-w-prose leading-relaxed text-[#4d4d4d]">
                Dr. Harris developed a love for dermatology while volunteering
                as a camp counselor at Camp Discovery, a summer camp for
                children with dermatologic skin conditions. He completed his
                internship and residency through Campbell University, his number
                one choice. He enjoys all aspects of dermatology, but found
                special interest in procedural and surgical dermatology, which
                led him to pursue a fellowship in Mohs Micrographic Surgery.
                When heâ€™s not working as a dermatologist, you can find Blair
                spending time with his wife and two daughters, exercising,
                enjoying the beaches, or doing projects around the house.
