              Dr. Blair Harris was born and raised in northern Utah. He graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in Business Management with an emphasis in finance. After working as a financial analyst at Lockheed Martin in southern California for three years, he decided to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a doctor. Dr. Harris attended medical school at Pacific Northwest University in Yakima, Washington. While in medical school, he was elected to a position in student government and enjoyed serving his fellow students. His leadership position enabled him to institute multiple organizational changes including implementing mental health resources, student support groups, and financial tracking instruments for the student government organization at PNWU.

              Dr. Harris developed a love for dermatology while volunteering as a camp counselor at Camp Discovery, a summer camp for children with dermatologic skin conditions. He completed his internship and residency through Campbell University, his number one choice. He enjoys all aspects of dermatology, but found special interest in procedural and surgical dermatology, which led him to pursue a fellowship in Mohs Micrographic Surgery. When heâ€™s not working as a dermatologist, you can find Blair spending time with his wife and two daughters, exercising, enjoying the beaches, or doing projects around the house.
